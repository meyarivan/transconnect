06 Feb  2002       Added Support for dns queries over DNS

version 1.2

version 1.0
-----------
29  Sep  2001	   Transconnect is now Stable. It has been working fine without any
		   serious bugs for a long time. So I thought to upgrade it from 
		   Beta :-)

29  Sep  2001	   Added the fclose(). We were earlier not closing the config file,
		   which could cause the limit of number of open files to be reached.

29  Sep  2001	   Changed the positioning of checks for non-TCP streams

27  Sep	 2001	   Transconnect now uses TCONN environment variable for config file
		   If not set defaults to the .tconn/tconn.conf file in home directory.
		   Using this sysadmin can set up the configuration for all the users.

27  Sep  2001	   Added a lot of Comments.

version 0.3
-----------

28  Aug  2001      Added the User-Agent header in Proxy Request

28  Aug  2001      Added Keep-Alive and no-cache in Proxy Request.( Though I believe that 
                        these are not needed. No proxy should cache a CONNECT request)
      
28  Aug  2001      make install now copies the old config file to tconn.conf.bak 

28  Aug  2001      The message from the server is displayed if the connection fails.

11 April 2001      The cvs update had caused all the changes done by binand to be
                        lost. Corrected some of them.

11 April 2001      Added TCONN_ to all defines local to this program in order to
                        avoid conflicts with any system wide defines.

11 April 2001      Added another check for func not being equal to connect. This
                        happens when dynamic linking is not working.

10 April 2001      Changed the declaration of signal handler variables to make
                        it compile without warnings on SunOS.

10 April 2001      Added a file libcpath.h which may be modified to use this
                        program on *BSD.
                        
10 April 2001      Added a check for func being NULL in directconnect so that it
                        returns Network unreachable if dynamic linking does not work.

23 March 2001      Removed the checks for inet_addr returning -1, as we set the
                        address to 255.255.255.255 in that case.

23 March 2001      Applied the patches for NetBSD and OpenBSD.
                        (Thanks to Harald Fielker, Sebastian Stark and Jared D. McNeil)

11 Mar 2001            Changed the order of include files, due to warnings on NetBSD.
                        (Thanks to Jared D. McNeil)
