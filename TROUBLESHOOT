    So, you are facing problems with transconnect. The following tips may
be of some help. However if nothing works out, drop me a line.

    Also, if you have encountered any problems and solved them successfully,
and you feel they deserve a mention in this guide, please send me a 
description.

COMPILATION:
    *  Gives the following error on SunOS 5.6
            
        parse error before `socklen_t' 
        In function `connect': 
        number of arguments doesn't match prototype 

        -> Here's the 3 step plan (By somebody):

            1. add -Dsocklen_t=int -fPIC to your CFLAGS
            2. remove the const in the connect declaration
            3. change optlen from int to size_t
    

USAGE:
    *  telnet/irc etc work great. But I can't make it do ssh.

        -> Your ssh binary seems to be suid root. do a 
           ls -l $(which ssh)
           if the output is something like
           -rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root       168260 Nov  2  2000 /usr/bin/ssh 
              ^
           with s in place of x in the permissions, you have a suid ssh.
           If you have root access, do a 
           chmod -s $(which ssh)
           Otherwise, copy ssh to your home directory, say ~/bin, modify
           your PATH to search ~/bin first, and enjoy

    *  Our proxy does not allow HTTPS CONNECT to any other port than 443. How
           do I overcome this?
        -> Sorry friend, transconnect can't work with such paranoid proxies.
           Try some other http tunneling softwares.
