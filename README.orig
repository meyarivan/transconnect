                         TransConnect 
                Transparent Network Over HTTP Proxy

        Transconnect is an implementation to allow network connections over 
a HTTP proxy. This should work under almost all linux distributions using 
glibc, and all proxies allowing https CONNECT (eg squid).

        I have tested this on Squid/2.2 for telnet, ftp(passive only), ssh, 
pine, fetchmail, whois, irc, realplayer, and yahoo messenger and netscape.
I have also used rsync to mirror the entire 2.4 kernel directory using this.
If you can/can't use any other programs, do inform me.

        This program will not work if you want to run a suid executable. So
if your ssh is suid, either remove the suid bit or copy it to another name
and use that.

        Read the files INSTALL and CONFIGURE for how to install and configure 
this software.
